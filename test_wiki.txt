This is a test of [[Wikipedia]] links and compression.
The [[Order-6]] model should detect these [[link patterns]].
Testing [[cascading]] fallback from Order-5 to lower orders.
Multiple [[links]] like [[this]] and [[that]] create context.
The [[hybrid]] approach combines [[text]] and [[link]] models.
This should show [[improvement]] over baseline [[compression]].
