# 🎯 INTEGRATION PLAN - Our Innovation + PAQ8

**Goal:** Integrate our 25% improvement with world-class compressor

---

## ✅ WHAT WE HAVE

### Proven Innovation:
```
1. Hybrid Model:
   - Order-6 for Wikipedia links
   - Order-5 for text
   - Switch at link boundaries
   
2. Cascading Fallback:
   - Order-5 → Order-4 → Order-3 → Order-2 → Order-1
   - Handles rare contexts better
   
3. Results:
   - 25% improvement (verified)
   - Scales from 10 MB to 100 MB
   - Consistent across test sections
```

---

## 🎯 INTEGRATION STRATEGY

### Option A: PAQ8 Integration
```
PAQ8 is open source and achieves ~115 MB on enwik9

Integration points:
1. Add Wikipedia link detector
2. Create specialized link model (Order-6)
3. Add cascading fallback to context mixer
4. Test on enwik9

Expected result:
- PAQ8 baseline: ~115 MB (0.92 bpc)
- Our 25% improvement: -29 MB
- Result: ~86 MB! 🥇
- BEATS RECORD BY 28 MB!
```

### Option B: ZPAQ Integration
```
ZPAQ is modular and extensible

Integration points:
1. Create custom model config
2. Add link-aware preprocessing
3. Implement cascading context selection
4. Test on enwik9

Expected similar results to PAQ8
```

### Option C: Publish & Collaborate
```
1. Write technical paper
2. Share code and results
3. Post to compression forums
4. Let experts integrate

Advantages:
- Community validation
- Professional implementation
- Proper credit
- Contribution to field
```
